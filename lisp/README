This directory contains the file tcconf-mode.el.  It defines an Emacs
major mode suitable for editing configurations files readable by
libtc.  Automatic indentation and syntax highlighting is provided.  To
use it, put it somewhere your Emacs will find it, and add
(require 'tcconf-mode) to your init.el or .emacs.  It has been tested
with XEmacs 21.4.13.  It may or may not work with other versions.
